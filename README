IF YOU USE VISUAL STUDIO 2010 YOU MUST COMPILE SFML FROM SOURCE!

GLES20.cpp/h is currently the only supported graphics wrapper.

All extern calls should be done via [hxgl.core.HXGL]. Never bypass directly with Lib.load.

Required libs for hxgl.ndll:
	sfml-window
	sfml-system
	glew32

Common Problems:
	All:
		Shaders not working correctly?
			Uniform/Attrib locations are not explicitly bound.
			If you assign a Uniform and no not use it, that slot
			will be removed during shader compilation.
				uniform sampler2D texture1;	//Not used
				uniform sampler2D texture2; //Assigned at [0]
				void main ()
				{
					gl_FragColor = texture2D (texture2, ...); //Uses slot [0]
				}
			So basically, make sure everything declared is used.
	Windows:
		Window loads and immediately crashes: Compile with vstudio 2008
		hxgl_*_* not found: Place hxgl.ndll into bin/c++
	Linux: 
		SFML 1.6 fails on a symbol error, no fix yet. Use SFML 1.5
		hxgl_*_* not found: Move hxgl.ndll to /lib
		        (Still failing? export LD_DEBUG=libs and run again)

NME:
	Some recent changes heavily break nme support.
	A fix is coming.

flash.display3D.*:
    Functional, but very limited.

Differences:
	setVertexBufferAt (... does not support _HINTS_ in flash);
	
	Still need HxSL target. Waiting on HxSL extension.

Hinting:
   	setVertexBufferAt (default_params...., hxgl.core.GLEnums._HINT_);
   
   	You can suppply a hint with your buffer binds to tell fixed function
   	where to place the buffer and whether or not to use it.

   	This method will be obsolete soon.
	
Compiling:
	Use latest HaXe/HXCPP nightlies.
