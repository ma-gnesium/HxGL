hxgl.ndll and most of the hxgl.* files are now legacy.

hxgl.core.Window is now the class handling graphics access.

Getting started:
	Creating a window handle:
		var wnd = hxgl.core.Window.create ("Name",width,height);
		
	Accessing contexts:
		wnd.gl					//GL specific binds (JS/CPP/Java). WebGL spec.
		wnd.display3D		//(in development) Full cross platform context
		wnd.d3d					//(future) Directx binds (Windows)
		
		Standard usage will be wnd.display3D, but gl/d3d are offered
		for platform specific features.
	
	Multiple windows:
		Multiple windows are supported! Please refer below for details
		on active window selection.
		
	Active windows:
		Windows must be active to recieve the proper commands
		wnd.activate( ); //wnd.display3D.* is now valid
		
		Only one window may be active at a time;
		wndA.activate( );
		wndB.activate( );
		wndA.display3D.drawTriangles(...);   //Invalid! Do not do this!
		
	Other commands:
		[Window].
			close( );
			position( x, y );
			resize( width, height );
			isOpen( );		//false if window no longer exists (User closed)
			process( );		//swap buffers, process window messages, etc...

Required files for for gl.ndll:
	sfml-window.so/dll
	sfml-system.so/dll

Common Problems:
	Windows:
		Window loads and immediately crashes: Compile with vstudio 2008
		gl_*_* not found: Place hxgl.ndll into bin/c++
	Linux: 
		SFML 1.6 fails on a symbol error, no fix yet. Use SFML 1.5
		gl_*_* not found: Move hxgl.ndll to /lib
		        (Still failing? export LD_DEBUG=libs and run again)

NME:
	Some recent changes heavily break nme support.
	A fix is coming.

flash.display3D.*:
    	Being refactored, will be available on [Window].display3D soon.

Shaders:
	HxSL is not yet supported, you must manually bind and load GLSL shaders.
	
Compiling:
	Use latest HaXe/HXCPP nightlies.
